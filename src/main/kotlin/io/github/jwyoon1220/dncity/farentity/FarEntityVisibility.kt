/**
 * Server-side line of sight for far players: [FarEntityServer] only sends a viewer the far players it could see, so a
 * modified client never receives the position of someone hidden behind terrain (an anti-wallhack measure in the spirit of
 * Valorant's "Fog of War", applied here to the long range only; vanilla tracking range is unchanged).
 *
 * The test is the same terrain march the client uses for drawing ([FarEntityMath.isOccluded]), run on the server's own
 * Distant Horizons data ([DhTerrainColumns], [EDhApiLevelType.SERVER_LEVEL]: built from real chunks, so a player's
 * buildings count once DH has re-read the chunk) on a background thread, because DH's lookups block. To keep players from
 * popping in late, the viewer's eye is also tried a step to either side and a jump up ([FarEntityMath.peekEyes]) against
 * the target's head, chest and feet, and a player that was visible stays sent for [VISIBLE_GRACE_NANOS].
 *
 * Fails closed: a pair is not sent until a check has said "visible", and without DH on the server (or before DH has
 * loaded the dimension) nothing is sent at all. `-Ddncity.farEntities.serverOcclusion=false` turns the check off (every
 * far player in the radius is sent, as before), e.g. for a server that does not run DH.
